          <h2>Built by People Who Understand Your Challenges</h2>
          <p>We have worked on the frontlines in hospitality, retail, and customer service. We know the frustration of training staff only to watch them churn, and the pain of customers waiting while employees search for answers.</p>
          <p>That is why we built Taskorly—an AI assistant that learns your business and guides your team through every situation, making training faster and operations smoother.</p>
